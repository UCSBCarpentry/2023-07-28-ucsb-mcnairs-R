# Code Document Workflow
RStudio allows researchers to write R code alongside their own narrative musings. 
R is one of the most popular statistical programming languages in the world. It's free, Open Source, and has a giant user community. When combined with version control with Git, and collaborative sharing on github (or any one of a gazillion other places to share code), you have a powerful scientific computing system, as well as a variety of publishing options such as: pdf, well formated responsive web pages, and presentation slidedecks.

There is also a certain flavor of nerd (we say with all love), who keeps all of their daily life notes in markdown. Those are the sorts of folks who do a lot of this stuff.
