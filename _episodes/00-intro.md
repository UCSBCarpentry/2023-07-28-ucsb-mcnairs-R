title: "Overview"
teaching: 6 hours
exercises: lots!
questions:
- "What will we be doing the next 3 weeks?"
objectives:
- "Acquaint ourselves with scientific computing in RStudio"
keypoints:
- "There's no need to run between gDocs/MS Word and gSheets/Excel. Do your computation and your writing all in the same place."

# Code Document Workflow
RStudio allows researchers to write R code alongside their own narrative musings. 
R is one of the most popular statistical programming languages in the world. It's free, Open Source, and has a giant user community. When combined with version control with Git, and collaborative sharing on github (or any one of a gazillion other places to share code), you have a powerful scientific computing system, as well as a variety of publishing options such as: pdf, well formated responsive web pages, and presentation slidedecks.

There is also a certain flavor of nerd (we say with all love), who keeps all of their daily life notes in markdown. Those are the sorts of folks who do a lot of this stuff.
